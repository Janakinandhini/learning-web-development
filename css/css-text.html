<p>A letter to My Dear,</p>
<p id="p1">I may not have said that ever but I just wanted to tell you that I'm really proud of having you.
Whenever I see you, I see a beautiful soul.
Your creativity,your dedication towards everything you do inspires me to be like you.
I still remember how you dignifiedly handled your flaws and conquered your weak points.
</p>
<p>
    I promise to be there for you,supporting you,helping you by standing behind you and beside you.
    Just don't run towards perfection.All I need you to do is just keep yourself calm and trust the process, everything will fall into place.
    I wish you all success in this wold.
    Most importantly, Don't forget to smile.</p>
<p>With Love,<br> Me
