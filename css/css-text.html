    <p>A letter to My Dear,</p>
    <p id="p1">I may not have said that ever but I just wanted to tell you that I'm really proud of having you.
        Whenever I see you, I see a beautiful soul.
        Your creativity,your dedication towards everything you do inspires me to be like you.
        I still remember how you dignifiedly handled your flaws and conquered your weak points.
    </p>
    <p>
        I promise to be there for you,supporting you,helping you by standing behind you and beside you.
        Just don't run towards perfection.All I need you to do is just keep yourself calm and trust the process,
        everything will fall into place.
        I wish you all success in this world.
        Most importantly, Don't forget to smile.</p>
    <p>With Love,<br> Me
    </p>
