    <div>Hi,<br>
        <br>
        It all started when I was walking on my knees,
        I kept coming to you during my hardest times,whenever I felt weak.<br>
        You made me feel strong, being there.</br>
        You are my first love.</br><br>
        No one can replace you,you'll be that one person.</br>
        Though,we are far apart, I hold you close to my heart.</br>
        I'm sad that we drifted apart for most of our time together.</br>
        I still recall the walks we took and the rides we rode.</br>
        No matter where I go in life,you'll be my number one man.<br>
        Thanks a lot for being there.<br><br>
        You made me walk in few tough paths alone I realized why did you do so.<br>
        I'm glad to say that you have raised me to be the strongest women through my hardships.<br>
        Eventhough I might not say,immensely blessed is how I feel whenever I think of you.<br>

        <p class="sign">With Love,<br>
            Your Proud Daughter
